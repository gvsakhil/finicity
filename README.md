## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

I have been working with Finicity as part of my project, where it doesnot have any support for Flutter. I took an initiative to create one plugin as its one of my dream working on my own custom plugin. This is the first plugin in my career, so please do raise PR's if something can be improved.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

```
Add this finicity: ^0.0.4 as part of your pubspec.yaml file

Initialize the plugin using final _finicityPlugin = Finicity();

As a next step call initFinicity which starts the Finicity SDK
var result = await _finicityPlugin.initFinicity(connectUrl);

Note: To generate connect url follow this - https://developer.mastercard.com/open-banking-us/documentation/connect/generate-2-connect-url-apis/
